# Media kit publishing checklist

## Asset rules

- Allowed types: PDF, PNG, JPG, SVG, and WebP only.
- Naming convention: lowercase, hyphenated, no spaces (e.g., `joel-klemmer-headshot-v1.png`).
- Alt text required for all image assets and must describe the subject plainly.
- Versioning rule: increment the `version` field on any change and update `date` to the publish date.
