# Public-Position Safety Posture

**Purpose:** Defines safe language patterns, disclaimers, and operational rules for a public-sector executive maintaining a public authority site. Ensures statesman credibility, neutral posture, and minimal operational exposure. No political advocacy; no confidential employer details.

**Scope:** All published copy, proof library content, contact pathways, and public communications that could be attributed to the site or its principal.

**Related:** [PGF](../pgf.md) (tone and copy), [Proof attachments standard](../proof/attachments-standard.md), [Authority copy bank](../authority-copy-bank.md).

## 1. What to Avoid Publishing (Operational)

Do not publish content that:

| Category                        | Avoid                                                                                                                  | Rationale                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Employer**                    | Internal policies, org charts, budgets, project names, vendor names, timelines, or any non-public institutional detail | Preserves employer confidentiality; avoids attribution of internal views |
| **Policy positions**            | Advocacy for or against specific legislation, parties, or candidates; endorsements; campaign-style language            | Maintains neutral public-service posture and statesman credibility       |
| **Unverified claims**           | Outcomes, metrics, or achievements that cannot be substantiated via Public Record or Case Studies                      | Proof-forward discipline; evaluator trust                                |
| **Personal data**               | Contact details, addresses, or identifiers of others without consent; sensitive personal circumstances                 | Privacy and consent; restraint                                           |
| **Forward-looking commitments** | Promises about future roles, deliverables, or institutional outcomes                                                   | Avoids binding the principal or employer                                 |
| **Comparative or competitive**  | “Best,” “leading,” “#1,” or comparisons to other individuals or institutions                                           | Restraint; no marketing or persuasion                                    |
| **Legal or regulatory**         | Legal advice, regulatory interpretation, or statements that could be read as official guidance                         | No creation of reliance or exposure                                      |

**Rule:** When in doubt, omit. The site is a verification dossier and professional record, not a channel for advocacy or institutional disclosure.

---

## 2. Proof Library Standards (Verification Posture)

The proof library (Public Record and attached artifacts) must maintain a **verification posture**: evidence is presented for evaluator review, not as endorsement or guarantee.

### 2.1 Stance

- **Proof-forward; not proof-dependent.** Methods and frameworks can be described without requiring that every sentence be backed by an artifact; claims that are presented as factual must link to Public Record or Case Studies where applicable.
- **Artifacts support, they do not replace, institutional context.** The site does not speak for any employer; artifacts that originated in an institutional context should be described with source and date, not as current policy or official position.
- **Verification posture language:** Prefer “available for review,” “documented in Public Record,” “see artifact” over “proven,” “certified,” or “guaranteed.”

### 2.2 Artifact and Entry Rules

- Follow the [Proof attachments standard](../proof/attachments-standard.md): accepted types, redaction rules, provenance metadata, naming, integrity (SHA-256, manifest, entry–manifest consistency).
- **No legal exposure:** Redact or omit material that could create legal or confidentiality risk; document redactions inside the artifact.
- **Authority calibration:** Claims in artifacts must be defensible and consistent with the Public Record entry and linked claims; no hype, no exclamation points.
- **Source clarity:** Every artifact has clear source (sourceName, sourceType, sourceUrl when appropriate). No unattributed or “internal only” material that could be misread as official institutional output.

### 2.3 Safe Formulations

| Avoid                                                    | Prefer                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| “Proves,” “certifies,” “guarantees”                      | “Documented,” “available in Public Record,” “see artifact” |
| “Official position” (unless clearly personal-site scope) | “Summary,” “record,” “artifact”                            |
| Unlinked assertions about outcomes                       | Claims linked to Public Record / Case Studies              |
| Artifacts without provenance                             | Artifacts with source and date in entry frontmatter        |

---

## 3. Conflict-of-Interest Safe Statements

The site must not create the impression that the principal is speaking for an employer, trading on official position for private gain, or blurring personal and institutional roles.

### 3.1 Principles

- **Personal capacity.** Content is presented in personal capacity unless explicitly stated otherwise in a narrow, defined context (e.g. “Views are my own” where the platform permits and employer policy allows).
- **No endorsement.** Do not imply employer endorsement of the site, its content, or any linked third parties.
- **No use of office for private benefit.** Do not use official title, employer branding, or institutional resources in a way that could be read as leveraging public office for the site’s or principal’s private benefit.
- **Separation of channels.** The site is a personal authority/verification presence. Institutional communications stay on institutional channels.

### 3.2 Safe Formulations

| Context            | Safe pattern                                                                                                                                  | Avoid                                                                  |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Identity           | Name and professional context (e.g. “executive evaluation, board review”) without naming employer in sensitive contexts if required by policy | “Representing [Employer],” use of employer logo or official letterhead |
| Views              | “Views are my own” only where employer policy permits and scope is clear                                                                      | Implying employer endorsement or official position                     |
| Roles              | Describe roles in past tense or general terms where current employer could be inferred inappropriately                                        | Current title in a way that suggests employer sponsorship of site      |
| Links / references | Neutral description of third-party content; no “we recommend” or “official”                                                                   | Endorsement of products, services, or other individuals/institutions   |

### 3.3 Disclaimer Use

- A short, restrained disclaimer (e.g. that the site and views are personal, not endorsed by any employer) may be used where it does not conflict with employer communication policy. Keep it factual and brief; do not use disclaimers to imply that otherwise risky content is acceptable.
- Do not rely on disclaimers to permit content that would otherwise violate this posture (e.g. confidential details or advocacy).

---

## 4. Communications Discipline Rules

### 4.1 Tone and Voice

- Align with [PGF](../pgf.md): quiet authority, no hype, no exclamation points, short paragraphs, evaluator-facing, evidence-led, restraint over persuasion.
- **No marketing.** The site is not a promotional channel. Avoid superlatives, urgency, or persuasion patterns.
- **Consistent vocabulary.** Use [Authority copy bank](../authority-copy-bank.md) and approved CTAs (e.g. “Send role inquiry by email,” “Send board inquiry by email”) so that contact pathways are clear and non-duplicative.

### 4.2 Approval and Consistency

- Copy that describes roles, outcomes, or institutional context should be reviewable against this document and the proof library; no ad hoc claims that cannot be traced to Public Record or Case Studies.
- When updating claims or proof, ensure artifact and entry consistency (manifest, SHA-256, labels, redactions) per the proof attachments standard.

### 4.3 Channels

- **Single public narrative.** The site’s published narrative (Brief, Case Studies, Public Record, Contact) should be consistent; avoid contradictory statements across pages or artifacts.
- **No unofficial “leaks.”** Do not use the site to release information that would be inappropriate to release through official or approved channels.

---

## 5. Privacy and Security Language Patterns (Restrained)

Privacy and security copy must be accurate, minimal, and non-promotional. Avoid overclaiming or creating expectations that cannot be met.

### 5.1 Privacy

- **Factual only.** State what is collected, how it is used, and how long it is retained in plain language. No “we value your privacy”–style marketing; prefer “This site …” or “We collect …” with concrete verbs.
- **No overpromise.** Do not claim “no data is ever shared” or “fully anonymous” unless the technical and operational reality supports it. Prefer “we do not share … with third parties for marketing” or similar precise statements.
- **Consent and telemetry.** If the site uses analytics or telemetry, say so; state that consent is required where applicable and that events are not sent until consent is given. Align with [authority-telemetry](../authority-telemetry.md) and any cookie/consent implementation.
- **Contact data.** If contact pathways collect or process data (e.g. email), state purpose and retention briefly; do not invite unnecessary personal detail in prompts.

### 5.2 Security

- **Restrained.** Reference security practices only where relevant (e.g. HTTPS, security.txt). Do not claim “military-grade” or “unbreakable” security.
- **Contact for reporting.** If a security contact is published (e.g. in `.well-known/security.txt`), use a dedicated channel and a neutral formulation (e.g. “Report vulnerabilities to …”) without overpromising response times or outcomes.
- **No confidential detail.** Do not describe internal security controls, architectures, or procedures that could expose the employer or the site to risk.

### 5.3 Safe Formulations

| Avoid                       | Prefer                                                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| “We value your privacy”     | “This site collects …” / “We do not share …” (concrete)         |
| “Your data is safe”         | “Data is transmitted over HTTPS” / “We do not sell …” (factual) |
| “State-of-the-art security” | “We follow …” or omit unless specific and verifiable            |
| Vague “we may use cookies”  | “We use … for …; consent is required for …” (clear scope)       |

---

## 6. Contact and Inquiries (Exposure Control)

Contact pathways must be clear, purpose-specific, and bounded so that they do not create expectation of official response, institutional commitment, or inappropriate disclosure.

### 6.1 Principles

- **Pathway separation.** Use distinct pathways per [Authority copy bank](../authority-copy-bank.md): role inquiry, board inquiry, media request, correction request (public record), general message. Each pathway has a single, clear CTA (e.g. “Send role inquiry by email”).
- **No commitment to response.** Do not promise response times, availability, or outcomes. Prefer “Send … by email” over “We will respond within …” unless operationally sustainable and intended.
- **Channel only.** The site offers a channel (e.g. mailto or form that sends email). It does not imply that the principal or any institution is obliged to answer, endorse, or act.
- **No intake of sensitive data.** Do not invite submission of confidential, proprietary, or highly personal information through the site. Contact copy can state that only non-confidential inquiries are appropriate.

### 6.2 Safe Formulations

| Avoid                                          | Prefer                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Contact us for a response”                    | “Send … by email” (action-only)                                          |
| “We’ll get back to you within 48 hours”        | Omit or “Responses are not guaranteed” if any expectation must be stated |
| Single generic “Contact” for all purposes      | Role-specific CTAs (Send role inquiry by email, etc.)                    |
| Inviting attachments of confidential documents | “Do not send confidential or proprietary information” (if needed)        |

### 6.3 Media and Third-Party Inquiries

- **Neutral channel.** A “Send media request by email” pathway is a channel only; it does not imply availability for interview, endorsement, or official comment.
- **No on-site commitment.** Do not publish statements that the principal or employer will comment on specific topics or through this site. Any such commitments belong to institutional or agreed external channels.
- **Corrections.** “Send correction request by email” (public record) is the appropriate pathway for factual corrections to Public Record or site content; state that corrections are reviewed and that not all requests will result in changes.

### 6.4 What Not to Do

- Do not use contact pathways to solicit or collect information that could create legal, confidentiality, or conflict-of-interest exposure.
- Do not promise that inquiries will be forwarded to an employer or any third party unless that is true and permitted.
- Do not imply that the site or principal speaks for any institution in responding to inquiries.
