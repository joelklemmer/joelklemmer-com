# Authority Design Constitution

## JoelKlemmer.com

This document defines the non-negotiable perceptual, psychological, institutional, and accessibility doctrine governing interface decisions.

This is NOT guidance.
This is enforcement-layer specification.

All agents must comply.
All visual decisions must align.
All tokens derive from this doctrine.

Version 1.0 — Foundational Doctrine

This document establishes the non-negotiable perceptual, cognitive, institutional, and engineering principles governing the authority ecosystem interface.

It exists to ensure:

- Executive-level credibility
- Institutional neutrality
- Psychological trust formation
- Accessibility leadership
- Future scalability
- Political interpretability safety
- Systemic visual cohesion

No agent, tool, or designer may deviate from this doctrine.

## I. Perception Objectives

The interface must simultaneously project:

- Strategic Cognition
- Systems Construction
- Operational Transformation
- Institutional Leadership
- Public Service Statesmanship

These signals must be emitted through environment, not language.

---

## II. Color Doctrine

### A. Psychological Requirements

Color usage must reinforce:

- Stability
- Intellectual authority
- Rational neutrality
- Governance maturity
- Emotional restraint

The interface must never appear:

- Promotional
- Corporate SaaS
- Political campaign
- Trend driven
- Startup styled

### B. Primary Spectrum

**Foundation Dark**

- Deep Navy #0F172A
- Slate Core #1E293B
- Charcoal Text #111827

**Foundation Light**

- Warm Neutral #F8FAFC
- Soft Slate #E2E8F0
- Paper Base #FFFFFF

**Structural Accents**

- Steel Blue #3B82F6
- Muted Cyan #0EA5A4
- Neutral Divider #CBD5E1

### C. Forbidden Color Use

- Neon saturation
- Marketing gradients
- Political red/blue emphasis
- Brand identity coloring

## III. Typography Doctrine

### A. Authority Hierarchy

Typography must signal:

- Analytical rigor
- Education
- Precision
- Composure
- Seniority

### B. Stack

**Primary:** Inter Variable

**Secondary fallback:** System UI stack

**Future optional evolution:** IBM Plex Sans or Source Sans 3

### C. Weight Governance

| Role            | Weight  |
| --------------- | ------- |
| Hero Identity   | 700–800 |
| Section Headers | 600     |
| Body            | 400     |
| Metadata        | 350     |
| Labels          | 500     |

### D. Line Length

- 65–75 characters optimal
- Prevents cognitive fatigue

---

## IV. Spatial Doctrine

### A. Grid Discipline

- 12 column desktop
- 8 column tablet
- 4 column mobile

### B. Spacing Ratios

- Base unit: 8px
- Multipliers only: 8, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128
- No arbitrary values permitted.

### C. Density Principles

Environment must communicate: order, thought, restraint.

Never: crowded, empty minimalism, decorative whitespace.

---

## V. Image Doctrine

### A. Portrait Requirements

- Neutral background
- Controlled lighting
- Professional posture
- No stylistic filters
- Documentary tone

Image must communicate: reliability, capability, composure.

### B. Placement Governance

Portrait never dominates interface. It supports identity, not branding.

---

## VI. Iconography Doctrine

Icons must be: geometric, monoline, non-expressive, non-playful.

**Preferred:** Radix / Lucide class

**Avoid:** emoji tone, rounded cartoon icons, skeuomorphic visuals

---

## VII. Motion Doctrine

Motion must reinforce: precision, control, continuity.

**Allowed:** subtle elevation, fade transition, scale micro feedback

**Forbidden:** bounce, elastic, parallax spectacle, decorative animation

---

## VIII. Interaction Doctrine

Interactions must feel: predictable, immediate, reversible, structured.

Navigation must communicate: clarity, stability, reliability.

---

## IX. Accessibility Doctrine

Accessibility is not compliance. It is an authority signal.

**Required:**

- Full keyboard navigation
- Screen reader semantic structure
- Focus visibility
- Reduced motion support
- Contrast verification
- ARIA correctness

---

## X. Layout Signaling Doctrine

The home environment must express:

- Identity Establishment
- Authority Framing
- Evidence Pathways
- Cognitive Navigation
- Institutional Context

Never marketing narrative sequencing.

---

## XI. Performance Doctrine

Perception of competence correlates directly with: render speed, input latency, layout stability.

**Targets:**

- LCP &lt; 2s
- CLS near zero
- TTI minimal

---

## XII. Governance Principles

All visual and UX decisions must pass:

- **Executive Review Test:** Would a board member trust this environment?
- **Institutional Test:** Would a policy reviewer consider this serious?
- **Political Neutrality Test:** Does this signal affiliation?
- **Psychological Trust Test:** Does this calm or excite?
- **Longevity Test:** Will this age poorly?

---

## XIII. Enforcement

This constitution overrides: aesthetic preference, AI suggestions, design trends, tool defaults.

Agents must reference it prior to execution.

---

## XIV. Immediate Next Step

Now that doctrine is established, we proceed to the next operational phase: Palette Token Engineering.

Transforming doctrine into tokenized system architecture integrated with:

- Tailwind tokens
- CAS layer
- Theme engine
- Accessibility validation
