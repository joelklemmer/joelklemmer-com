Case Study Evidence Bundle Reference

Scope
Case studies are work products with mandatory proofRefs to Public Record. Each case study references at least one recordId. ProofEntryScreen displays "Referenced by case studies" for each record.

Evidence
Case study frontmatter schema enforces proofRefs array; content-validate fails if any proofRef does not match a Public Record id. Bidirectional linkage is implemented and validated.

Outcome
Evidence bundle is consistent. Evaluators can traverse from record to case studies and from case study to records.
