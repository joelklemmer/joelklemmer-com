Content Operating System and PGF Adoption Record

Scope
The Content Operating System enforces proof-forward, evaluator-grade content. It is governed by the Presentation Governance Framework (PGF). Tone: quiet authority; no hype; short paragraphs; no exclamation points.

Evidence
Content OS and PGF docs define page intent, proof linkage, localization, and UI copy rules. Validators (content-validate, pgf-validate) run in CI. Copy decision log records approved terms.

Outcome
Adoption is verifiable via documentation and passing validation gates. No duplicate H1 or lede across core screens.
