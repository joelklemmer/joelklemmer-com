## What we use

- **Essential:** Required for the site to function (e.g. consent preference storage, security). No consent required; these do not track you across sites.
- **Analytics (optional):** First-party or consented third-party analytics to understand usage. Only loaded after you accept analytics in [Cookie preferences](#) or the preferences modal.
- **Functional (optional):** Preferences or features that are not strictly necessary. Only loaded after you accept functional cookies.
- **Marketing (optional):** We do not use marketing or advertising cookies on this site. If we did, they would load only after consent.

## Your choice

You can change your cookie preferences at any time using the **Cookie preferences** control in the site header or footer, or on this page. Withdrawing consent stops non-essential scripts from loading on subsequent pages; already-loaded scripts may need a page refresh to fully stop.

## Storage

Consent is stored in a first-party cookie so we can honour your choice on the next visit. The cookie does not contain personally identifiable information beyond your choices. You can delete it in your browser to reset preferences.
