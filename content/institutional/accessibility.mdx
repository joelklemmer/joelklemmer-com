## WCAG target

This site targets **WCAG 2.2 Level AA** conformance for public content and navigation, with AA+ operational practices where feasible.

## Compatibility

- Full keyboard navigation is supported.
- Content is structured for screen readers (semantic landmarks, headings, and labels).
- Visible focus states and reduced-motion support are provided.
- Language and direction are declared; locale switching is available.

## Known limitations

Some third-party or embedded content may not meet the same level. We work to minimize gaps. If you encounter a barrier, please report it.

## Response time

We aim to acknowledge accessibility feedback within a reasonable period. We do not promise specific SLAs. Remediation depends on severity and resources.

## Testing practices

Accessibility is tested with automated and manual methods, including axe, Playwright accessibility checks, and Lighthouse, aligned with this repository’s tooling.

## Feedback

Report accessibility issues via the [Contact](/contact) page. Include the affected page and a clear description of the issue so we can reproduce and address it.
