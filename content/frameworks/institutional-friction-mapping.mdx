Map where institutions create friction before you design around it. Identify points where structure, process, or incentives slow decisions or block alignment. Use the map to prioritise changes that reduce reversible friction and to accept or work around the rest. Align governance and operations to the map so that strategy addresses real bottlenecks instead of assumed ones.
