Compress the decision horizon to the shortest interval over which commitments remain reversible and information remains actionable. Long horizons invite over-planning and lock-in; short horizons force clarity on what must be decided now versus what can wait. Align governance cadence and reporting to the compressed horizon so that boards and delivery share the same temporal frame.
