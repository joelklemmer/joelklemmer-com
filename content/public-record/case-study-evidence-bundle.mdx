## Scope

Case studies are work products with mandatory proofRefs to Public Record. Each case study references at least one recordId. ProofEntryScreen displays "Referenced by case studies" for each record.

## Evidence

Case study frontmatter schema enforces proofRefs array; content-validate fails if any proofRef does not match a Public Record id. Bidirectional linkage is implemented and validated.

## Outcome

Evidence bundle is consistent. Evaluators can traverse from record to case studies and from case study to records.
