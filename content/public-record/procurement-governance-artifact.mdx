## Scope

Governance operating system content describes method and constraints for program and procurement transformation. Deliverables are documented as artifacts with dates and verification notes.

## Evidence

Operating system page defines scope and read path. Procurement and transformation outcomes are linked to public record where evidence exists. No unverified claims.

## Outcome

Stable reference for evaluators reviewing governance and procurement capability. All assertions tied to dated records.
