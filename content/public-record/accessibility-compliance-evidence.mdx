## Scope

Accessibility compliance is governed by the institutional accessibility page. Test evidence is produced by automated a11y runs (e.g. Playwright a11y config). Contact and review cadence are stated.

## Evidence

Governed page includes effectiveDate, lastReviewedDate, nextReviewDate. CI runs a11y validation. No claim of certification without a separate dated record.

## Outcome

Evaluators can confirm posture and test approach from published policy and CI evidence.
