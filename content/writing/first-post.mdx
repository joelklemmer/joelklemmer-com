## Purpose

Briefings are most effective when scope, evidence, and risk are stated early.
This note documents a compact structure that reduces ambiguity.

## Structure

- Start with the decision that must be made
- List evidence that is already verified
- Separate unknowns from risks

## Outcome

The result is a readable path for action without noise.
