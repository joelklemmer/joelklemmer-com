/**
 * Lighthouse CI budget gate stub. When Lighthouse CI is added to the repo,
 * replace this with a real runner (e.g. @lhci/cli or lighthouse-ci) that:
 * - Runs Lighthouse on key routes (/, /brief, /media)
 * - Enforces performance/budget thresholds (e.g. LCP, FCP, bundle size)
 * - Fails the build if budgets are exceeded.
 * See docs/program/authority-platform-program.md (Step 5 / Phase 5) for TODO.
