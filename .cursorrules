Project: JoelKlemmer.com (quiet-authority, proof-forward briefing site)

NON-NEGOTIABLES
- apps/web route files must be thin: no page over 120 lines.
- No hardcoded strings in UI. All copy must come from i18n messages or MDX content.
- All reusable UI goes in libs/ui.
- Design tokens go in libs/tokens.
- Content pipeline in libs/content.
- SEO utilities in libs/seo.
- Accessibility utilities in libs/a11y.
- Page composition in libs/screens and libs/sections.

REQUIRED FEATURES
- next-intl locales: en, uk, es, he with RTL for he.
- WCAG 2.2 AA: skip link, focus-visible, semantic landmarks, reduced motion.
- Routes: /, /brief, /work, /operating-system, /writing, /contact
- Quiet links (footer only): /press, /proof, /bio, /faq, /now
- Executive Brief (/brief) is the canonical internal hub.

DO NOT
- Do not create monolithic components in apps/web.
- Do not inline styles outside Tailwind + tokens.
- Do not add placeholder lorem ipsum. Use minimal real copy.
